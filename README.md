# Step 1: Shell Start
start the shell by running make in the directory with the shell.c program. This will build the shell executable for you. Then run the shell and you should get a output similiar to the one below.

# Command List
The shell should be able to relay any commands your present shall has built in. However there are some built in commands particular to this shell. Below is an example of ls being run relayed from the shell underneath.
